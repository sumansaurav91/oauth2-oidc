# Brief History of Authentication and Authorization

| # | Year | Description |
| - | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | **1970s - Early Authentication** | Username and password systems introduced |
|  | | UNIX password system (1974) - First widespread implementation of hashed passwords |
|  | | Passwords stored in /etc/passwd with basic encryption |
| 2 | **1980s - Network Authentication** | Kerberos (1988) - MIT developed for Project Athena |
|  | | First major ticket-based authentication system |
|  | | Introduction of symmetric key cryptography for authentication |
|  | | Challenge-response protocols emerged |
| 3 | **1990s - Web Authentication** | HTTP Basic Authentication (1996) - RFC 2068 |
|  | | SSL/TLS introduced (1995) - Secure communication layer |
|  | | Cookies introduced by Netscape (1994) |
|  | | Form-based authentication became common |
|  | | X.509 certificates for client authentication |
| 4 | **2000s - Federation Era** | SAML 1.0 (2002) - First major federation standard |
|  | | SAML 2.0 (2005) - Enterprise single sign-on |
|  | | OpenID (2005) - Decentralized authentication |
|  | | OAuth 1.0 (2007) - API authorization for web applications |
|  | | LDAP widespread adoption for directory services |
| 5 | **2010s - Modern Standards** | OAuth 2.0 (2012) - Simplified authorization framework |
|  | | OpenID Connect (2014) - Identity layer on OAuth 2.0 |
|  | | JWT (JSON Web Tokens) popularization |
|  | | Multi-factor authentication became mainstream |
|  | | Social login widespread adoption |
| 6 | **2020s - Advanced Authentication** | Passwordless authentication gaining traction |
|  | | FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards |
|  | | Zero Trust Architecture |
|  | | Biometric authentication widespread |
|  | | Continuous authentication models |

# Why OAuth and OIDC Matter?

1. Complete Solution
  - OAuth 2.0: Authorization ("what you can do")
  - OIDC: Authentication ("who you are")
  - Combined coverage of modern identity needs

2. Real-world Adoption
  - Used by major platforms (Google, Microsoft, Facebook)
  - De facto standard for API security
  - Supported by major identity providers

3. Future-Proof
  - Active development and improvement
  - Strong security considerations
  - Evolving with new requirements
  - Growing ecosystem
